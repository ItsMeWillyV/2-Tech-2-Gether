      bio: "Hello there! I'm Willy Vanderpool, an 18-year-old Computer Information Science student at Ozarks Tech. I'm currently working in Ozarks Tech's Web Services department, and I'm also the president of Tech2Gether. My passion for programming started long before college, sparked by curiosity and a love for creating things from scratch. Over the years, I've gained experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C#, Java, and Lua, and recently I've been diving deeper into modern frameworks such as React, TailwindCSS, and .NET MAUI. Outside of programming, some of my hobbies include drawing pixel art, playing videogames, and collecting Pok√©mon cards. I've also been learning German since around mid January 2025."

      bio: "My name is Paul Bute, and I'm a CIS student at Ozark's Tech. I'm the current Vice President of Tech2Gether. My goals for the club this year are to boost engagement and engage students in programming challenges and competitions. As of the beginning of the Fall semester, it will be my 2nd year at Ozarks Tech. I'm mainly a Web Developer, with experience in C# ASP.NET apps, as well as JS & Vue. I enjoy learning new skills and exploring how problems can be solved in more than one way. I enjoy reading, gaming & baking in my free time. Before Ozarks Tech I was part of the workforce for 7 years. I have experience in warehouse picking, shipping & handling, management and customer service. I also spent four years in the hospitality industry, and a year as a Tower Technician doing structural modifications on cell phone towers."

      bio: "Hi, I'm Diego. I've been a student at Ozarks Tech since fall 2024, and after attending a few Tech2Gether meetings, I knew I wanted to contribute my time and energy to this club. Since I've been at Ozarks Tech, I've been learning and honing my skills in C#, Python, and Web Development. I'm currently pursuing an Associate's degree in CIS, but I may switch to CSC and pursue a Bachelor's degree instead. My hobbies include weightlifting, cooking, and coding."

I have enjoyed all that I've learned in my time at Ozarks Tech: Python, C#, .NET MAUI, Java, and Web Development. In my free time, I love building Magic: The Gathering decks, writing/playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends, and playing/building videogames. I'll be graduating in the Spring 2026 Semester (hopefully) so look out for officer nominations in the spring to get my job! I'm so excited to help Tech2Gether continue its outreach to students by providing fun educational, networking, and programming events to members and all Ozarks Tech students alike! It's going to be a fun year."
